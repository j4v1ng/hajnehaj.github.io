                The ruins of Haj Nehaj Castle, perched majestically above Sutomore, stand as a silent guardian of Montenegro's rich history. Built in the 14th century during the reign of the Balšić dynasty, this fortress played a crucial role in defending the Adriatic coastline. 

Legend speaks of a beautiful noblewoman who lived in the castle during the Ottoman sieges. When the fortress was about to fall, rather than surrender, she chose to leap from the highest tower, her white dress billowing like wings as she descended. Local folklore says her spirit still watches over the castle on moonlit nights.

The name "Nehaj" itself comes from the phrase "Ne hajati" - meaning "to not care" or "careless," perhaps reflecting the fortress's seemingly impregnable position. During the Venetian period, the castle was known as Fortezza dei Spizi, serving as a vital stronghold against Ottoman expansion.

In 1542, the Ottoman forces, led by Hayreddin Barbarossa, finally captured the castle after a prolonged siege. Despite changing hands between Venetians and Ottomans multiple times, the fortress maintained its strategic importance throughout the centuries.

The castle's architecture reflects its military purpose, with thick walls designed to withstand cannon fire and strategically placed arrow slits providing defenders with commanding views of potential attackers. The remains of a chapel within the fortress walls testify to the spiritual life of its inhabitants.

Today, visitors climbing to Haj Nehaj are rewarded with breathtaking panoramic views of the Adriatic Sea, Sutomore's beaches, and the surrounding mountains. On clear days, one can even spot the Italian coast across the sea - the same waters once patrolled by Venetian galleys.

Recent archaeological excavations have uncovered numerous artifacts, including medieval weapons, pottery, and coins, providing glimpses into daily life within the fortress walls. Each discovery adds another piece to the fascinating puzzle of Haj Nehaj's history.

The castle remains an enduring symbol of Montenegro's resilience and rich cultural heritage, drawing history enthusiasts and adventure seekers from around the world to explore its ancient stones and experience the legends that echo through its corridors.
