            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Perched majestically at 231 meters above sea level, the Haj-Nehaj fortress complex stands as an enduring monument to Montenegro's rich historical tapestry. Overlooking the modern city of Sutomore, this dual-fortress structure embodies centuries of strategic importance and cultural heritage, combining the mighty Haj (Tabija) and the formidable Nehaj fortifications into a single, awe-inspiring complex.

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Ancient Origins</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
                Archaeological excavations have revealed that human presence in the Haj-Nehaj area stretches back to prehistoric times. The hillsides have yielded a treasure trove of artifacts spanning multiple civilizations: Illyrian relics from the Iron Age, Roman settlements, and Byzantine remains all tell the tale of continuous human habitation long before the fortress's official documentation in the 15th century.

    <!-- The Legend -->

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">The Legend of the Rooster</h2>
            <div class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-8 mb-8">
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    One of the most captivating tales of Haj-Nehaj's origins centers around Serbian King Stefan Uroš II Milutin (1282-1321). According to legend, the king initially planned to build the fortress atop Velji Grad, a 497-meter peak. Ancient tradition demanded that the first stone be consecrated with blood, but as a Christian monarch, King Milutin refused human sacrifice.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Instead, a rooster was chosen for the sacrifice. As its head was severed, the bird allegedly cried out "Nehaj!" before its headless body took flight, landing on a nearby hill. Interpreting this as divine intervention, the king chose this new location for his fortress. This legendary tale intertwines with linguistic history, as "hajati" in ancient Serbian meant "to worry," making "Nehaj" translate to "worry not" - perhaps a reassurance of the fortress's protective strength.

    <!-- Venetian Period -->

        <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">The Venetian Era</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The first official documentation of the fortress appears in Venetian records from 1542, where it was known as "Fortezza de Spizi." The name derives from the Spich plain (modern Sutomore), itself possibly originating from the Latin "hospitium," suggesting the area's role as a refuge for travelers between Dalmatia and Constantinople.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Despite its impressive capacity to house 900 people, Venetian records from 1555 reveal a surprisingly minimal garrison of just three men - two soldiers and an artilleryman. This understaffing would ultimately contribute to the fortress falling to Ottoman control without resistance in 1571.

    <!-- Ottoman Period -->

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Ottoman Dominion</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The Ottoman period, spanning from 1571 to 1877, saw significant expansion and fortification of the complex. The Turks embarked on an ambitious modernization program, involving local communities in the construction efforts. This period gave rise to the fortress of Tabija, established or reconstructed in 1862 on Celo Brdo ("Bald Hill").
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                During this era, a fascinating legend emerged about women's involvement in the construction. As they carried building materials uphill, they composed songs, one particularly poignant line surviving: "Teško tebi, Nehaj grade, kad te žene grade" (It's hard for you, Nehaj-city, when women build you). This period of construction ended when a Turkish supervisor, moved either by compassion or superstition, halted the practice of using female labor.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Predating the fortress walls themselves, the Church of St. Demetrius stands as a testament to the region's religious history. Built in the 13th or early 14th century, it originally served both Catholic and Orthodox faithful, though only the Orthodox altar survives today. The church's history reflects the complex religious dynamics of the region, maintaining its Christian character even under Ottoman rule until the 1860s.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The structure's fate took a dramatic turn when Mehmet Pasha converted it to a gunpowder storage facility. Its adjacent cemetery, destroyed in 1868-1869, and damage from subsequent fires, explosions, and the 1979 earthquake, tell a story of resilience and preservation challenges. Today, the rectangular church with its eastern semicircular apse stands as a silent witness to centuries of religious and cultural transformation.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The fortress complex's modern history began with Montenegrin liberation in 1877, followed by Austro-Hungarian control in 1878. Today, the fortress stands as a powerful symbol of Montenegro's rich cultural heritage, offering visitors not just spectacular views of the Adriatic coastline, but a tangible connection to centuries of Balkan history.
